## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Configuration

The project includes:
- ‚úÖ `netlify.toml` - Deployment configuration
- ‚úÖ SPA redirects for React Router
- ‚úÖ Security headers
- ‚úÖ Asset caching
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check build logs for missing dependencies

### App Doesn't Load
1. Verify environment variables are correctly set
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure contract addresses are valid

### Wallet Connection Issues
1. Verify `VITE_PROJECT_ID` is correct
2. Check Reown Cloud project settings
3. Ensure domain is added to allowed origins

## üåê Production Considerations

### For Mainnet Deployment:
1. Update contract addresses to mainnet versions
2. Change RPC URLs to mainnet endpoints
3. Update chain IDs accordingly
4. Use production Reown Project ID

### Security:
- Environment variables are automatically secured by Netlify
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Regularly rotate API keys and project IDs

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify environment variables match exactly
3. Test locally with `npm run build && npm run preview`
4. Check browser developer console for errors
